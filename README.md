<b>Double Knitting Pattern Generator</b>

This is a simple web application designed to help knitters create and visualize double knitting patterns. It allows users to design a pattern for the front and back of a knitted piece independently and then automatically generates a combined chart, which can be downloaded as an image.

<b>Features</b>

Two Input Charts: Design patterns for the "Front" and "Back" of your double knitting project on separate grids.

Automatic Combined Chart: See an instant visualization of how your front and back patterns combine into a single, comprehensive chart.

Intuitive Pattern Representation: Cells in the combined chart clearly indicate stitch types and color combinations (e.g., black cell with a white dot for knit black/purl white).

Adjustable Grid Dimensions: Easily change the number of rows and columns to suit your project size.

Zoom Functionality: Zoom in for detailed work or zoom out to see the overall pattern.

Image Download: Download the generated combined chart as a PNG image for printing or reference.

Image Copy to Clipboard: Conveniently copy the combined chart image to your clipboard.

Restart Function: Clear all charts and start a new design with a single click.

Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript: No complex build tools or server-side dependencies. Runs directly in your browser.

<b>How it Works</b>

Double knitting creates a fabric with two distinct faces, often in reverse colors. This tool helps you plan patterns where:

Single-Color Area: If both the front and back cells are the same color (e.g., both black), the combined chart shows a solid cell of that color (e.g., pure black). This means you knit with yarn of that color on both sides.

Two-Color Area: If the front and back cells are different colors (e.g., front black, back white), the combined chart shows a cell with a background color matching the front, and a contrasting dot representing the back color. This indicates a "two-color" double knit stitch where one yarn color is knitted and the other is purled, creating distinct patterns on each side.

<b>Combined Chart Legend:</b>

 Black cell with White dot (⚪): Front is Black, Back is White. (e.g., Knit with Black yarn, Purl with White yarn)

 White cell with Black dot (⚫): Front is White, Back is Black. (e.g., Knit with White yarn, Purl with Black yarn)

 Pure Black cell: Both Front and Back are Black. (e.g., Knit with Black, Purl with Black)

 Pure White cell: Both Front and Back are White. (e.g., Knit with White, Purl with White)

<b>Getting Started</b>

To use this tool, you only need a web browser.
